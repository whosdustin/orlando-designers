I’m an animator, illustrator and creative director at [Park Ave Co](https://www.parkave.co/). I love the creative process of writing scripts, storyboarding, designing and animating. Also, a husband, a dad whose wardrobe consists of an irrational amount of black t-shirts.

In my free time, I love volunteering in design and social issues. I’m an admin at [Orlando Designers Slack Group](https://orlandodesigners.info/), a volunteer director at [Seek Justice Media](https://www.seekjustice.media/), and involved with a number of other programs with [AIGA Orlando](https://orlando.aiga.org/).
