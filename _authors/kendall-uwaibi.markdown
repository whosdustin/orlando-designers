I’m an animator, illustrator and creative director at Park Ave Co. I love the creative process of writing scripts, storyboarding, designing and animating. Also, a husband, a dad whose wardrobe consists of an irrational amount of black t-shirts.

In my free time, I love volunteering in design and social issues. I’m an admin at Orlando Designers Slack Group, a volunteer director at Seek Justice Media, and involved with a number of other programs with AIGA Orlando.
