This has quickly become a tradition, so for the third year in the row lets celebrate the end of the year with another round of Presentation Karaoke!

Compelling storytelling during presentations and improvisation during user research are essential skills for UX Designers. We'll once again be hosting a UX Open Mic Night and practicing some improvisation via an activity called Presentation or PowerPoint Karaoke. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPoint_Karaoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPoint_Karaoke)

The general idea is to pick a UX related topic and then give a presentation on it - with 5 slides you've never seen before. Sounds easy, right?!

Regardless of if you are excited to get up and give an impromptu presentation, or if you just want to enjoy the show, we look forward to seeing you there for this online event!
