@Parker Young Here's another one from @Kyle Harter: How does one make a transition from a role as a motion design generalist into a UX motion designer? What skills are transferrable? What skills should one develop?\

@Parker Young To piggyback on the first question about your background and career journey, you mentioned you did a lot with your hands, like cardboard forts and Legos, and then discovered the camcorder. Did you animate at an early age? And what were some of your early animation/design/artistic influences?\

@Parker Young Can you share an experience where you didn't think you could do something, that felt impossible, but that you managed to do anyway? Reflecting on it, what helped you accomplish that thing?\
